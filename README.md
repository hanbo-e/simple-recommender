# simple-recommender
A simple nmf based movie recommender created as part of my coursework for week 10 at spiced academy.
My aim was to learn how to deploy a model in a web application.
I used scikit-learn's NMF model and trained it on MovieLens 100K data
for my recommender.
I used Flask for building my application and Bootstrap to make it look
presentable.
